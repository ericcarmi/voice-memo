# voice memo

this is similar to voice memos on macOS

some features are not there yet (zoom, pan...) but I did add a spectrogram, used webgl for the first time...not great but it works

the file names can be edited in place and I added a prefix + counter to modify the file name to help with creating files for datasets (file name descriptor as a word or phoneme, the counter will increase to allow for quickly recording many samples of the word or phoneme)
